-Spring Security, OAuth on mongoDB.
-Restrict views of other userdatas, only allow users to see/update api/userDatas/{id}.
-make history parser.
-history should be hash map of {date: { coin {
                                              strike price
                                           volume
                                              sell or buy  }}}

- i then can use the date as the X axis and (volume*coin + cash at date) as Y axis.
